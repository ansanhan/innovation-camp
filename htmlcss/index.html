      <h2>Imagine being able to track reasons for absense in schools, and to fully prevent it.</h2>
    </div>
    <!--her kommer litt informasjon om idéen-->
    <div class="infotext">
      <p>According to UNESCO, only 86% of children in Ethiopia start school. Out of these, there are <strong>61.8%</strong> who
        do not graduate from primary school.
        An astoundishing 1.6 billion children do not attend school - that is an entire generation.
        Even before Covid-19, there were 258 million children who did not attent school.
        Education is an extremely important part of people's lives, and our goal is that every child is able to attend.
        Education contributes to development in the society and better quality of life. Without education, the society moves backwards, and will be forced to start anew.

    <h3>We want to turn this imagination into reality...</h3>
    <div class="solutionText"><img class="appbilde" src="img/Appen1.png" alt="Our app">
      <p><h4>Our solution</h4> is to create an app that tracks student attendance in Ethiopian primary schools. <br><br>
        In the app, you get an automatic message from your teacher when you've been absent for more than five days in a row.
        Here you can choose a reason, or write your own. The template answers help the schools collect reasons for absense, and track absense trends.<br><br>
        Digital tools are effective when gathering data for statistics. By digitalizing attendance and absense in schools, 
        we get the information we need and avoid risking attendance in paper form getting lost. <br><br>
        By using these tools, we are able to see the reasons for absense on a regional and national basis, and can go through with political decisions that secures better attendance in schools.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>The app</h4>
        is used by all primary schools in Ethiopia, and each student gets their own, personal QR code. <br><br>
        In this QR code, there's information saved about you that contributes to discover absense trends. It has your age, gender and school.
        When you get to school in the morning, you scan your own personal QR code in your designated classroom. <br><br>
        When your QR code is scanned, your information is sent to a database that collects data from every school. This way, it is possible to see if your age, gender or school has something to do with your absense.

    <h3>...and this is how we will achieve it</h3>
   <div class="howText">
    <img class="recycleBilde" src="img/Recycle.png" alt="Recycling smartphones">
     <p>
       We plan to recycle used phones from Europe in order to give Ethiopian school children smartphones.<br><br>
       To achieve this, we will enter into agreements with the European mobile operators to get "old" smart phones from them.
       We will also have stations all over Europe where people can donate their old phones. <br><br>
       <br>
       Ethiopia's goal is to have power in the entire country by year 2025.
       Google wants to expand the wifi connection across the country, which means that technology will be available for most students by 2025. <br><br>
       We plan to enter into a coorporation with Google, which benefits both Google and the Ethiopian people.
       Google gets cheaper labor, and the Ethiopian people get jobs and training. By giving more people stable jobs, we hope that more children are able to go to school instead of helping their families.
       Investing in such technology also creates positive repercussions in the entire community.<br><br>
       By digitalizing attendance, we are able to gather data and compare, present for further measures, and more easily prevent the reasons for the absense.
